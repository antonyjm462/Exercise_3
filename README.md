## Configuration & Setup

1. **Install Flutter:**
   - Follow the [Flutter installation guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) for your OS.

2. **Get Dependencies:**
   - Open a terminal in the project directory and run:
     ```
     flutter pub get
     ```

3. **Run the App:**
   - For web (Chrome):
     ```
     flutter run -d chrome
     ```
   - For Android/iOS:
     - Connect your device or start an emulator/simulator.
     - Run:
       ```
       flutter run
       ```

## Gameplay & UI

- **Drag the Bucket:** Use your finger (mobile) or mouse (web) to drag the bucket horizontally at the bottom of the screen. The bucket's movement is smoothly animated and restricted within the screen bounds.
- **Level-based Buckets:** The bucket image updates with each level, using `lib/assets/buckets/{level}.png`. The level variable is clamped to the available bucket images.
- **Score Display:** A score indicator with a baseball icon appears at the top left, styled with a yellow background and rounded corners.
- **Animated Elements:** The game uses Flutter's `AnimatedPositioned` for smooth bucket movement and other UI transitions.
